# Bikesharing - NYC Citybike Sharing Analysis

## Overview
City bikes is prevalent in major american metro cities. Kate and I vacationed in New York and enjoyed and bicycled around the city's major places. After vacation, I had an idea to open a similar bikesharing programme / business in Des Moines Iowa, where I wanted to replicate a bikeshare program to that of NYC. Kate is excited about the prospect of having a bike share program in the city of Des Moines and has been able to introduce the business idea to an angel investor. Iâ€™ll create a story in Tableau and write a report that describes the key outcomes of the NYC Citibike analysis in the module and in Deliverable 2.

## Results & Findings
