# Bikesharing - NYC Citybike Sharing Analysis

## Overview
City bikes is prevalent in major american metro cities. Kate and I vacationed in New York and enjoyed and bicycled around the city's major places. After vacation, I had an idea to open a similar bikesharing programme / business in Des Moines Iowa, where I wanted to replicate a bikeshare program to that of NYC. Kate is excited about the prospect of having a bike share program in the city of Des Moines and has been able to introduce the business idea to an angel investor. Iâ€™ll create a story in Tableau and write a report that describes the key outcomes of the NYC Citibike analysis in the module and in Deliverable 2.

## Results & Findings

After gathering the data about the city bikesharing programme in NYC. Kate and I used a .csv file and translated / analysed the data on Tableau. Here are some of the key findings: 
An overview of the dashboard story created on Tableau that depicts NYC bikesharing such as trips within a time span, average trip duration, gender breakdown of bikeshare users, starting location, etc:

Other visualisation include trip data, which shows weekday trips per hour + weekday trips per hour with gender breakdown:

Delving deeper into trip duration by user group and gender... one can see that the checkout time varies by user:

Lastly, we looked at the top 10 stations / locations for starting and ending trips:

## Summary & Conclusion

Based on the visualisations above, one can conclude that the over 80% of the user groups are subscribers to the bikesharing programme. Therefore, in order for the Des Moines registry to be successful, a similar model might be adopted which will likely mean loyal users. Also, more than half of the users for the NYC bikeshare are males and top starting and ending locations are generally the same. I'd say this is a good model to replicate for the Des Moines city bike programme.
